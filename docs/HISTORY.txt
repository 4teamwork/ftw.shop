  [lgraf]

  SystemUsers / ldap users.
  [mathias.leimgruber]

- BugFix: If the fullname of a logged in user had umlauts the form was broken.
  :-)
  [mathias.leimgruber]

- Eliminate all uses of the IShopRoot interface.
  Instead we use the navigation root to register views that are supposed to be shop-global.
  This will make ftw.shop work with subsites that are supposed to have "their own shop".
  [lgraf]

- Rebuild logic behind manage_categories view:
  Don't search for categories to list downwards from shop root, but instead upwards
  from current context. This will only return contiguous shop category structures,
  and should therefore work nicely for setups with decentralized shop structures.
